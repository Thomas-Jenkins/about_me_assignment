    <h1>About Thomas P Jenkins</h1>
    <section>
        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>Thomas Jenkins was born on February 29th 1992. His family moved to Nevada before his first leap birthday in 1996. The son of a miner and a bus driver, Thomas Moved often until his he was two and one half leap years old settling in Spring Creek Nevada until graduating at the leap age of Four.</p>
        <p>After graduating High School Thomas worked for several years as a blackjack dealer in Elko. The work was easy, the pay was good, but the lifestyle was draining and unsatisfying. It wasn't long before Thomas got tired of the routine monotony of the small towns and decided to move to the 'biggest little city' in the world.</p>
        <p>Thomas Arrived in Reno with no car or home but with a dream. "To deal Blackjack at a 'Real' Casino!". This didn't work out as Thomas never dealt blackjack again. Instead he worked any dredge job he could find. Moving freight, installing cable, undersigning loans, and assembling equipment. This was back breaking work that paid poorly. But with hard work and a whole lot of debt Thomas purchased a car and finally had made it. Not very far.</p>
        <p>After buying the car, Thomas began working for a cannabis cultivation company. He loved the work and his coworkers and moved up the ladder quickly. But after the acquisition of the company by a multinational corporation things turned south. His coworkers began leaving and the work became micromanaged to an unsustainable point. So he did what any sensible person would do and went back to dredge work.</p>
        <p>Now seven and one half leap years old Thomas realized there was little gain in throwing his body at problems. Using brute force and ignorance to solve issues when he knew had the ability to work smarter not harder. So at the advice of some friends Thomas sold his car, quit his job, and joined ALchemy Code Labs to learn to write computer programs. The rest, I assure you, will be history.</p>
